# Systems Engineering Course Repository

Welcome to the repository for my Systems Engineering course at NYU. This repository contains detailed analyses and a project related to various aspects of systems engineering. Below is a brief overview of the contents:

## Analysis of Passenger Automobile Subsystems and Complex Systems
I have provided a detailed analysis of passenger automobile subsystems, including test interfaces, and in-built test indicators. The analysis is presented from the perspective of systems engineering, highlighting the importance of these subsystems in the overall functioning of the automobile. Additionally, I have provided a detailed analysis of complex systems, focusing on the need analysis and the need for technology evolution.

## Project: Human-Robot Teaming with Spot Robot
The project in this repository delves into systems engineering within the domain of human-robot teaming, using the Spot robot as an example. The project covers need analysis, concept exploration, concept definition, pre and post-production, testing, evaluation, operation support, and more. It provides a comprehensive view of applying systems engineering principles in real-world scenarios.

Human-Robot Teaming (HRT) describes how humans and robots work together in tasks. HRT combines human adaptability with robotic precision, crucial for industries with risky, monotonous, or complex tasks. 

Boston Dynamics' Spot Robot exemplifies HRT: It's a versatile quadruped with advanced sensors and user-friendly interfaces, able to navigate varied terrain, maintain balance, and interact with its surroundings. Spot Robot illustrates systems engineering principles like hardware-software integration, real-time communication, and performance optimization. This complexity includes mechanical design, sensor integration, control algorithms, and human interfaces. 

Studying systems engineering in human-robot teaming with Spot involves analyzing its design, subsystem interactions, and real-world use. This provides insights into applying systems engineering to develop and use robots like Spot.
